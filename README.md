# controle-de-fluxo
A example project created with Intellij to demonstrate some Java Logic, based in DIO BOOTCAMP

### The system receives two parameters via the terminal that will represent two integers, using these two numbers to obtain the number of interactions (for) and print the incremented numbers on the console (using a logger), for example:

- If the numbers 12 and 30 are passed, then we will have an interaction (for) with 18 occurrences to print the numbers, for example: "Printing the number 1", "Printing the number 2" and so on.
- If the first parameter is GREATER than the second parameter, a custom exception called ParametrosInvalidosException will be thrown with the message: "The second parameter must be greater than the first"
